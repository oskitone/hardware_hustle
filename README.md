# Hardware Hustle

A pen-and-paper game for 1+ players about sustainably running a small hardware business.

Still very much work-in-progress.

## Running

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in Chrome and print double-sided on legal size paper.

(Despite being a website that _kind of_ works, this game is not designed to be played on a screen.)
