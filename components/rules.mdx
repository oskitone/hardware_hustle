# Hardware Hustle

DRAFT RULES

A pen-and-paper game where you try to run a little hardware business without burning out. Buy parts to make widgets to sell for profit to buy parts, ad nausem.

## Setup

The game is played solo or competitively. Each player will need:

- Hardware Hustle game sheet
- six-sided die
- calculator

## Taking a turn

You can think of a turn like a workday: you wake up, do some stuff, and then retire at the end of the day. Ideally, each day gets you further towards your goal, which is, unfortunately, to make the money that you need to continue making money.

The day is a graph and its columns are done in order from left to right:

1.  **AM:** Start the turn
2.  **Buy:** Buy Parts to make Widgets
3.  **Make:** Make Widgets from Parts
4.  **Sell:** Sell Widgets for Money
5.  **PM:** End the turn

<Turn
  className={styles.Turn}
  startingValues={{
    money: 0,
    opportunity: 0,
    A: 0,
    B: 0,
    C: 0,
    D: 0,
    AB: 0,
    ABC: 0,
    ABCD: 0,
  }}
/>

### AM

Your first day on the job starts with 10 Money and 12 Opportunity but nothing else. Nothing to do here but note what you've got... which for now is not much.

### Buy

We need to buy Parts to make Widgets for our store. Parts costs Money and Opportunity.

You can think of Opportunity as some combination of time, effort, and luck. You spend it like Money but, unlike Money, it refreshes each AM.

**"Roll for Opportunity"**: The maximum Opportunity that you can spend is determined by a die roll. You can spend less but not more than this value.

### Make

Make Widgets from Parts, costing Parts and Opportunity\*.

Again, Roll for Opportunity.

### Sell

Sell Widgets, costing Widgets (of course) and Opportunity\* but gaining Money.

Again, Roll for Opportunity.

### PM

Tally up your Actions' math and end the turn. If you have enough Opportunity remaining, you may be able to Research. Opportunity remaining, you may be able to Research.

If you over-spend Opportunity and go negative, you "burn out" and lose the entire next turn.

Otherwise, "Roll for Research". If the die's value is less than or equal to your remaining Opportunity, you get to upgrade one of your skills.

## End of Game

The player with the most money at the end wins. Solo play is solitaire; try to beat your best score.
