# Rules

## Introduction

Hardware Hustle is a tabletop, roll-and-write resource management game for one or more players about sustainably running a small hardware business.

It takes about 20 minutes to play, depending on the number of players.

## Game Overview

You have six turns to buy parts to make widgets, make widgets from parts, and then sell widgets for money to buy more parts.

Each of those actions takes opportunity <IconsParen ids={["opportunity"]} />, which you have less and less of as the game progresses. At the end of each turn, you can attempt a research upgrade to reduce future <Opportunity /> costs.

The six turns are small spreadsheets, and the game ends when they're all filled out. The player with the most money wins.

## Components

Each player needs:

- Hardware Hustle game sheet
- Six-sided die or "Roll Table" sheet
- Calculator or scratch paper for math (optional)

## Game Setup

Fill out the "{ID_TITLE}" line in the game sheet's top left.

The player with the _second_ highest die roll goes first, then proceed clockwise.

## How to Play

The spreadsheet's rows are grouped into money <IconsParen ids={["money"]} />, parts <IconsParen ids={["A", "B", "C", "D"]} />, widgets <IconsParen ids={["AB", "ABC", "ABCD"]} />, and opportunity <IconsParen ids={["opportunity"]} />.

Its columns are phases that you fill out from left to right.

{/* TODO: labeled graphic */}

1. ### AM
   Take stock of what you have
1. ### Buy
   Buy parts <IconsParen ids={["A", "B", "C", "D"]} /> using <Money /> and <Opportunity />
1. ### Make
   Make widgets <IconsParen ids={["AB", "ABC", "ABCD"]} /> using parts<br />and <Opportunity />
1. ### Sell
   Sell widgets for <Money /> using <Opportunity />
1. ### PM
   Use remaining <Opportunity /> to research or lose next turn if <Opportunity /> is negative

Let's walk through each phase in detail:

### 1. AM

Good morning! You start each turn taking stock of what you have and what you need.

For the game's first turn, there's nothing to do here besides note your starting values: <MoneyX value={10}/>, <OpportunityX value={12}/>, and 0 everything else.

### 2. Buy

Let's buy some parts. They cost <Money /> and <Opportunity />, as listed out in the Actions table on the left side of the game sheet:

<ActionsTable actions={[ACTIONS.BUY]} className={styles.ActionsTable} />

The <Opportunity /> costs are a table of values, but, for now, you'll only use the ones in the first column with the dark outline. To buy a <A />, you need <OpportunityX value={0} /> plus <MoneyX value={1} />; to buy a <B /> you need <OpportunityX value={1} /> plus <MoneyX value={2} />; etc.

To complete the Buy phase:

1. **Roll for <Opportunity />:** Roll a die. Its value is the _maximum_ <Opportunity /> you can spend buying.
1. **Decide:** Based on how much <Money /> you have in the AM column and the max <Opportunity /> you just rolled, decide which parts to buy.
1. **Write:** In the Buy column, write the values for the total <Money /> cost, the parts you bought, and the total <Opportunity /> they cost.

Notes:

- You can buy as much as you want and multiples of the same part, as long as you have the required <Opportunity /> and <Money />. (The sum <Opportunity /> must be less than or equal to your roll and the sum <Money /> must be less than or equal to what you have in the AM column.)
- Cells are prefixed by their mathematical operation. You're spending <Money /> and <Opportunity />, so those cells have a "**-**". You're gaining parts, so they have a "**+**". The same **-**/**+** signs are in the Actions table.
- Unused cells have a gray background to mark that they're skipped.
- Cells with no change can be crossed out or filled with 0.
- You can spend less <Opportunity /> than you roll, but you cannot spend more.
- You cannot spend more <Money /> than you have.

### 3. Make

Next, you'll use the parts you just bought to make widgets. The Actions table lists what you can make, their <Opportunity /> costs, and the parts that they'll consume:

<ActionsTable actions={[ACTIONS.MAKE]} className={styles.ActionsTable} />

Again, only use the outlined <Opportunity /> values for now.

{/* - <AB />: Amplifier
- <ABC />: Boombox
- <ABCD />: Game */}

To complete the Make phase:

1. **Roll for <Opportunity />:** Roll a die. Its value is the _maximum_ <Opportunity /> you can spend making.
1. **Decide:** Based on which parts you now have available and the max <Opportunity /> you just rolled, decide which widgets to make.
1. **Write:** In the Make column, write the values for the parts you used, the widgets you made, and the total <Opportunity /> they cost.

Just like in the Buy phase, you can make as much as you want, provided you have the parts and <Opportunity />.

### 4. Sell

If you made any widgets, now's a fine time to sell them. Note how the Actions table has you losing widgets but now gaining <Money />:

<ActionsTable actions={[ACTIONS.SELL]} className={styles.ActionsTable} />

To complete the Sell phase:

1. **Roll for <Opportunity />:** Roll a die. Its value is the _maximum_ <Opportunity /> you can spend selling.
1. **Decide:** Based on which widgets you made in the previous turn and the max <Opportunity /> you just rolled, decide which widgets to sell.
1. **Write:** In the Sell column, write the values for the <Money /> you made, the widgets you sold, and the total total <Opportunity /> they cost.

### 5. PM

Time to wrap the day up and end the turn.

To complete the PM phase:

1. **Tally:** Complete each row's equation into the final column prefixed with **=**.
1. **Resolve <Opportunity />:**
   - If <Opportunity /> is negative, you suffer **Burnout** and lose the entire next turn to rest.
   - Otherwise, **Roll for research**. Its value is the <Opportunity /> cost it would take to upgrade _one_ of the previous three actions: Buying, Making, or Selling.
1. **Plot:** Draw a dot on the "Money / Turn" chart at your new <Money /> total, then draw a line connecting it to the previous dot.

#### Burnout

Cross out the entire next turn's spreadsheet. You cannot do any of its phases.

#### Research Upgrade

Did you roll less than or equal to your remaining <Opportunity />? Congrats! Your research succeeded. Circle the cell to mark its success; otherwise cross it out to say it failed.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Success: &nbsp;</th>
      <td><ExampleCell success value={5} /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Failure: &nbsp;</th>
      <td><ExampleCell fail value={2} /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Recall how you've only been using the first column of <Opportunity /> values with the dark outline. If your research succeeded, choose _one_ action to spend it on, then cross its column out and outline the values to their right.

As an example, here's what the Actions table would look like after a successful research upgrade to Make:

<ActionsTable className={styles.ActionsTable} selectedIndexes={[0, 1, 0]} />

The non-researched action's <Opportunity /> costs remain unchanged.

Notes:

* The <Opportunity /> roll for research is used differently than buy/make/sell. For the other actions, it's a maximum that you want to roll high; for research, you want to roll low.
* Ending a turn with 6 or higher means your research attempt automatically wins. You can't roll higher than six!
* When an item uses <OpportunityX value={0} /> to buy/make/sell, it's effectively "free" to do for the rest of the game.

## Example turn

Here's an example of a completed first turn with a successful research upgrade:

<Turn
  className={styles.Turn}
  data={{
    money: [10, 5, undefined, 6, 11],
    A: [0, 1, 1, undefined, 0],
    B: [0, 2, 1, undefined, 1],
    C: [0, 0, 0, undefined, 0],
    D: [0, 0, 0, undefined, 0],
    AB: [0, undefined, 1, 1, 0],
    ABC: [0, undefined, 0, 0, 0],
    ABCD: [0, undefined, 0, 0, 0],
    opportunity: [12, 2, 1, 2, 8],
  }}
  suppliedColumns={firstTurnSuppliedColumns}
  researchSuccess={true}
/>

## Ending a turn

When your turn is done, hand the die to the next player so they can start their turn.

## Starting a new turn

The values in the PM column carry over to the empty cells in the next turn's AM column, as denoted by the "**â‡¢**" prefix.

The <Opportunity /> cells, however, are _not_ empty; you have to use the values provided.

## End of the Game

The player with the most money at the end of the six turns _without_ burning out in the last turn wins. Unused parts and unsold widgets count for nothing, only money.

In the case of a tie, the player with the fewest burnouts wins.

## Solo Mode

Solo play is solitaire. Try to beat your best score.
