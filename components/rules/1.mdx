# Rules

A pen-and-paper game for 1+ players about sustainably running a small hardware business.

## Setup

Each player will need:

- Hardware Hustle game sheet
- Six-sided die
- Calculator (optional)
- 20 minutes or so, depending on number of players

## Starting the game

For games with multiple players, the highest die roller goes first, then proceed clockwise.

Fill out the "{ID_TITLE}" line in the top left, then familiarize yourself with the Actions Cost table.

<ActionsTable className={styles.ActionsTable} />

Its icons represent:

- Parts
  - <A />: Fastener
  - <B />: Enclosure
  - <C />: Controls
  - <D />: Integrated Circuit
- Widgets
  - <AB />: Amplifier
  - <ABC />: Boombox
  - <ABCD />: Game
- <Money />: Money
- <Opportunity />: Opportunity

## Taking a turn

You can think of a turn like a typical workday: you wake up in the AM, do some stuff (Actions), and then rest in the PM. Ideally, the day's actions get you further towards your goal, which is, unfortunately, to make enough money to continue making money.

The turn's day is like a little spreadsheet. Here's an example of the first one when completed:

<Turn
  className={styles.Turn}
  data={{
    money: [10, 9, undefined, 6, 7],
    A: [0, 2, 2, undefined, 0],
    B: [0, 2, 2, undefined, 0],
    C: [0, 1, 1, undefined, 0],
    D: [0, 0, 0, undefined, 0],
    AB: [0, undefined, 1, 1, 0],
    ABC: [0, undefined, 1, 0, 1],
    ABCD: [0, undefined, 0, 0, 0],
    opportunity: [12, 4, 3, 2, 3],
  }}
  suppliedColumns={firstTurnSuppliedColumns}
/>

You can see that its rows are grouped into Money, Parts, Widgets, and Opportunity.

Its columns are Actions and are filled out in order from left to right. Let's walk through it:

### 1. AM

Your first day on the job starts with <Icon id="money" />10 and <Icon id="opportunity" />12 but nothing else. Nothing to do here but note what you've got... which, for now, isn't much!

### 2. Buy

Let's buy some Parts.

Parts cost Opportunity (<Opportunity />) and Money (<Money />), as shown in the Actions Cost table.

export default function Rules({ children, year, draftId }) {
  return (
    <div className={styles.rules}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );

}
