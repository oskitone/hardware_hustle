import styles from "@/styles/Rules.module.css";

import ActionsTable, { ACTIONS } from "components/actions-table";
import Icon, {
  Money,
  Opportunity,

} from "components/icon";
import Turn, { firstTurnSuppliedColumns } from "components/turn";

We'll say you roll 3, which, conveniently!, is all the <Opportunity /> you have left.

Remember how you've only been using the first column of <Opportunity /> values with the dark outline? You decide you want to be better at Making, so you cross out the previously used values to outline the whole column of new ones to their right.

{/* TODO: mark new PS values */}

<ActionsTable className={styles.ActionsTable} />

Nice! For the rest of the game, all Widgets will consume one less <Opportunity />, no matter how many of them you make! (With this Research, all <AB />s are effectively "free" to Make.)

#### Handoff

When your turn's done, for games with multiple players, hand the die to the next player so they can take their turn.

### Starting the next turn

The values in your PM column carry over to the empty cells in the next turn's AM column, as denoted by the "**â‡¢**" prefix

<Turn
  className={styles.Turn}
  id={1}
  data={{
    money: [7],
    A: [0],
    B: [0],
    C: [0],
    D: [0],
    AB: [0],
    ABC: [1],
    ABCD: [0],
    opportunity: [12],
  }}
/>

Note that <Opportunity /> is fixed back up to a high number, so you don't carry over your 3.

Later in the game, AM <Opportunity /> starts dwindling each turn &mdash; just like in real life, grinding is unsustainable and you naturally lose momentum.

## End of Game

### How to Win

The player with the most money at the end of the game _without Burning Out in the last turn_ wins!

(Unused Parts and unsold Widgets count for nothing, only Money.)

Solo play is solitaire; try to beat your best score.

### How to Lose

If you Burn Out in the last turn, you are too physically and emotionally exhausted to go to a very important family gathering the next day.

You were too preoccupied with money and lost sight of what really matters, so you lose.
